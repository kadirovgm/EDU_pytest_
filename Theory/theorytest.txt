AKVELON EDU: REST API automation testing (Python)
* i had a presentation related with these theme on notes (internship task)

Testing learning: Selenium, Linux(backend, web server), DB testing, Jenkins, Docker

API - application programming interface - the way(point) for connecting frontend(client) with backend (server).
it's a description, there is one computer program can interract with another computer program.
Web API consist of one or more publicly accesible endpoints for a system for exchanging specific request-response messages, which a usually described using JSON or XML and transmitted using HTTP.

REST - Representational State Transfer. This is architectural style of building the API endpoints of the application.

The REST services must meet the following requirements. It should be a:
- Client-server model
- Stateless
- Casheable
- Uniform interface (every resource is identificated by URL)
- Layered system
- Code on demand

APIs are open access endpoints, it's important to test it correctly.


PRACTISE: Pytest & requests frameworks

Terms:
1. Pytest - framework for configuring autotests
2. Requests - library for sending HTTP requests
3. pip - console utilite for managing packets
4. requirements.txt - contains list of packets for setup

Tutorial:
Pytest - framework - couple of classes
	Parallel mode
	Suite - set of test xases
	Precondition - Post condition
	Skip, fail
*pytest doing all of this for you

Selenium test
	Parallel mode
	Suite of test
	Simple group of test
	Condition
	Report
